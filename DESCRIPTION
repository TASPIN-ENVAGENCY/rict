Description: This is an R implementation of the River Invertebrate
  Classification Tool (RICT) system. This system is currently
  written in oracle SQL procedures. The model uses environmental variables
  to make predictions based on invertebrate reference data. It is based on
  the work of many other authors. See Freshwater Biological Association http://www.fba.org.uk/river-invertebrate-classification-tool-rict-and-rivpacs for details.
