Description: This is an R implementation of the River Invertebrate
  Classification Tool (RICT) system with some minor changes. This system is reimplementation of original
  Fortran and Oracle SQL procedures. The model uses environmental variables to
  make predictions based on invertebrate reference data. It is based on the work
  of many other authors. For background, user guides and technical information
  see Freshwater Biological Association http://www.fba.org.uk/river-invertebrate-classification-tool-rict-and-rivpacs
